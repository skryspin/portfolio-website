      <p>
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
      And sorry I could not travel both<br />
      And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
      And looked down one as far as I could<br />
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
      <br />
      Then took the other, just as fair,<br />
      And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
      Though as for that the passing there<br />
      Had worn them really about the same,<br />
      <br />
      And both that morning equally lay<br />
      In leaves, no step had trodden black.<br />
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
      I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
      <br />
      I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
      I took the one less traveled by,<br />
      And that has made all the difference.
